# Ferrum
WIP Mindustry mod written in Kotlin. Current features: (updated at v0.7.1)
- _Iron_ item and _Iron_ ore (ore disabled by default)
- _Pyrite_ item, obtainable from coal with the _Pyrite Extractor_
- _Ironworks_ produces iron from _Pyrite_ and graphite
- _Iron Extractor_ to extract iron directly from titanium ore
- **4 Turrets** requiring iron
- Many changes to vanilla progression and block requirements, including tech tree changes

Possible new features include:
- Steel, which many vanilla and modded blocks would require
- Magnetic items or blocks based on the ferromagnetic properties of Iron.
