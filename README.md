# Ferrum
Mindustry mod written in Kotlin revolving around iron and its applications.
Based on reality, moderately simplified for simple-minded gamers.

## Features:

- Many changes to vanilla progression and block requirements, including tech tree changes

### Items and Fluids:

- _Iron_ - 25% chance to replace titanium when mining with vanilla drills
- _Pyrite_ - 11% chance byproduct of mining coal
- _Steel_ - produced from _iron_ and coal, used to build many both vanilla and this mod's blocks
- _Sulfur Dioxide_ - gas produced from splitting _pyrite_, can cool guns almost as well as cryofluid
- _Sulfuric Acid_ - liquid produced from combining _sulfur dioxide_ and water, deals heavy damage when put in a wave or tsunami

### Production Blocks:

- _Smart Drill_ yields more byproducts than the vanilla drills, can use cryofluid or _sulfur sioxide_ to go real fast
- _Ironworks_ produces iron from _pyrite_ and graphite, creating _sulfur dioxide_
- _Steel Forge_ makes steel from iron and coal
- _Sulfuric Acid Plant_ produces, well, _sulfuric acid_
- _Steel Converter_ makes steel from iron, coal and _sulfuric acid_

### 6 Turrets, including:

- _Gustav_  - massive base-demolishing gun, only 1 may be built per map, can only be operated manually or via logic

Possible new features include:
- Magnetic items or blocks based on the ferromagnetic properties of Iron.
- More _unique_ blocks, which can
